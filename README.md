#Group Project Proposal

#Project Title - Language Exploration in U.S.

#Team Members: Michael Kuhn, Nathan Dieck, Krystal Wang

#Project Description/Outline: The project will study the geographic distribution of speakers of various major languages in the United States.

#Research Questions to Answer:

1. Percentage Check for English vs. Non-English households in U.S.- 

1). What percentage of households in each US state speak only English at home? Visualization: Bar chart for all states or a sample of states. 

2). What percentage of households in each US state speak a language other than English at home? Visualization: Bar chart for all states or a sample of states.

2. More Explorations for Specific Languages Spoken at home in U.S.- 

1). What is the geographic distribution of people who speak English, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese? At home. Visualization per language (5-6): Heatmap/county-shaded-map of people who speak the language at home by state or by county if possible.


2). What number of households speak English, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese at home?
Visualization: Bar chart covering the five languages. Are there any counties where a majority of hh speak a language other than english at home?

#Dataset to be used Language Statistics: 

ACS (2013) (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/language-stats.html)

#Breakdown of Tasks 

1. Collect the datasets used for the research questions using census API. 

2. Create Language/County dataframe: We need to develop a list of the counties surveyed or otherwise create a list of counties weâ€™re going to use using FIPS codes (to work with the census database) 

3. Clean Data 

4. Implement integration with gmaps for heatmap functionality
